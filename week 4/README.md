## Week 4

This folder contains the following resources to assist you in your studies:

- **Section Notes for Week 4**: A brief overview of conditional probability, covering key concepts such as the law of total probability, Bayes' Theorem, independence, and conditional independence. Additionally, I have included some exercises from CLAS in the section notes, which are similar to problems from past midterm exams.

- **Solutions to Study Guide for Week 3-4**: The solutions to the suggested practice problems from Week 3-4, which are available here for your review. You are highly encouraged to use these as an exercise and compare these solutions with your work to check your understanding.
